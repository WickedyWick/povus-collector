# POVUS COLLECTOR TOOL

## NOTE 

This is just altered version of [Project Gorgon Survey Helper](https://github.com/gchristopher/pg_survey_helper/)
99% of the code was written by the author of the Project Gorgon Survey Helper

### STATE

Currently pin system is functional, but resizing does not work atm
Resizing after posting pins will mess up pins positions
If you want to resize please do before starting to put down pins

### HOW IT WORKS

Left click anywhere on the map and pin will be created with 180 second timer (after harvesting first time), then click on the timer everytime you harvest a bush.After 3rd harvest (click) pin will dissapear as bush will too. 
When timer expires pins change colors.
If you need to force delete pin, click on it two times.
